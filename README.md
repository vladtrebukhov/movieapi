Movie search app utilizing the TMDb API.

To run locally, you will first need to generate your own TMDb API key from their website. Next, add this key to server.js. To spin up the front and back end, navigate to the client directory and run the command yarn dev in terminal. This will start the React front-end with react-scripts start and the back-end with nodemon server.js concurrently. Your browser should open to localhost:3000 but if it doesnt, navigate to this page in the browser to access the application.

(Note: logic lives in App.js, server.js and MovieComponent.js)
